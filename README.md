# OG-doughnuts-landingpage


## Overview
A landing page for a doughnut shop built with Sass. Utilizing flexbox and css grid I was able to create a fun grid to layout the images and also layout the over structure for the page. I pulled icons from Fontawesome and Material Icon to symbolize common actions. This added to clean look and fill of the landing page.
